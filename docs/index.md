# Vue Storefront 2 for Magento

Welcome to the documentation of Vue Storefront 2 integration for Magento 2.

It's part of our ecosystem of integrations and extensions, which you can learn more about in our [core documentation](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/v2/).

## Where to start?

To get started, see the following guides:

- [Introduction](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/v2/getting-started/introduction.html) to learn what is Vue Storefront
- [Installation](/installation-setup/installation.html) to install and setup new Vue Storefront project for Magento 2.

## Demo

If you want to see the integration in action, we have three demo environments where you can see and test Magento 2 integration for Vue Storefront in action. If you find a bug in any of them, please [create an issue](https://github.com/vuestorefront/magento2/issues/new/choose) in our repository to let us know about it.

### Production environment

In the production environment, you can see the latest **released and stable** version of the integration. It should be visually and feature-wise identical to the new project installed using our CLI.

### Staging environment

In the staging environment, we are testing new releases. It should be **relatively stable**, but you might still encounter some bugs.

### Development environment

In the development environment, we are testing the `develop` branch, which might contain unfinished or experimental features. It might be **unstable** both visually and feature-wise.
