# Magento Installation

Welcome to this Magento 2 installation guide! This guide will help you install Magento 2 on your local machine using our CLI.

:::tip
We created this guide to help you get up and running quickly.
If you already have a Magento 2 instance for development, you can skip this guide.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following tools installed:

::list{type="success"}
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.js installed.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - We recommend using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- [Magento Marketplace account](https://account.magento.com/customer/account/create/) - to get API credentials for your Magento instance.

## Installation using CLI

::tip
This is a beta version of the CLI. If you encounter any issues, please report them on **[GitHub](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/issues/new/choose)**. Thanks for helping us make the CLI better!
::

## Installation steps

**Supported OS:** MacOS, Linux, Windows (using WSL2)
If you are using Windows, please proceed with the [Manual Installation](https://docs.alokai.com/magento/installation-setup/installation.html#manual-installation) guide.

**Installation using CLI** is a quick and easy way to get your project up and running. It will install Alokai and Magento 2 instance locally using Docker. It will also generate sample data for your store *(optional)*.

The **CLI** will guide you through the installation process and ask you to provide the required information.

::tip
The CLI may take up to 10 minutes to complete the installation process. Please be patient.

::steps
#step-1
### Run CLI to create a new project

```bash
npx @vue-storefront/cli m2-only
```

Under the hood, the CLI uses [`markshust/docker-magento`](https://github.com/markshust/docker-magento) to install a Magento 2 instance locally using Docker.


#step-2
### Enter project name

When prompted, enter the name of your project. This name will be used as a directory name for your project.

```bash
┌ Welcome to Vue Storefront 2 CLI! 💚
|
◆  🚀  Please provide a name for the Magento 2 directory
|  magentolocal
```

::warning

Avoid using special characters and spaces in the project name.

::

#step-3
### Provide Magento 2 API credentials

When prompted, provide your Magento 2 API credentials. You can create them by following the [Get your authentication keys](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/installation-guide/prerequisites/authentication-keys) guide.

If you're logged in to your Adobe marketplace account, go to [Adobe Merchant Center - Magento 2 Access Keys](https://marketplace.magento.com/customer/accessKeys/) page, to generate the access keys.

When you see following prompt, enter your public and private key information.

```bash
◆ 🔐 Please provide your Magento access keys
|
◆ 🔑 Magento access key:
| <YOUR_MAGENTO_PUBLIC_KEY>
◆ 🔒 Magento secret key
| <YOUR_MAGENTO_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

#step-4
### Provide Magento 2 instance URL

When prompted, provide the URL of your Magento 2 instance:

```bash
◆ 🌐 Magento domain name
| <YOUR_MAGENTO_DOMAIN_NAME>
```

This URL will be used to connect Alokai to your Magento 2 instance - by default, the URL of the local Magento instance is `magento.test`. Meaning that your Alokai application can use the `https://magento.test/graphql` endpoint to communicate with Magento 2.

The CLI will start installing Magento 2 instance locally using Docker. It will take a few minutes.

::tip

You will be asked to provide system administrator password to allow Docker to run commands on your machine.

::

#step-5
### Generate sample data (optional)

When prompted, select the option to generate sample data:

```bash
◆ 🛒 Do you want to generate sample data for the store?
| > Yes / No
```

#step-6
### Congratulations! 🎉

You have successfully installed Magento 2 instance locally. You can now access connect your Alokai application using your instance's base URL and GraphQL URL. 🚀
