# Authentication

In this section, we will cover the basics of authentication.

## Overview
The authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It is used to protect your store from unauthorized access.
To authenticate a user, you need to provide a valid access token. The access token is a unique string that identifies a user. It is used to access protected resources in your store.
Here is the explanation of the authentication process in the Magento: [create a customer and generate customer token](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/rest/tutorials/inventory/create-customer/)

To access any user protected resource, you need to provide a valid access token. The access token is a unique string that identifies a user. It is used to access protected resources in your store.

Once token is generated, you should store it in the `vsf-customer` cookie. This cookie is used by the Magento 2 integration to authenticate the user.
Methods like `customer`, `customerCart`, `updateCustomer`, `changeCustomerPassword` require a valid access token stored in the `vsf-customer` cookie.
