# Products

In this section, we will cover the basics of products. We will show you how to fetch products from in a variety of ways.

## Overview
There are two main functions to fetch products from Magento 2: [productDetails](../api/magento-sdk/productDetails) and [products](../api/magento-sdk/products). Both are very similar and accept the same arguments. The main difference is in the reponse they return. The [productDetails](../api/magento-sdk/productDetails) method returns a single product related data, while the [products](../reference/api/magento-sdk/products) method returns a list of products related data.
The first one is optimized to be used on single product pages, while the second one is optimized to be used on product list pages like category pages, search results pages, etc.
