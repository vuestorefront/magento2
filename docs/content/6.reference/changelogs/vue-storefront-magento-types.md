### Patch Changes

- [#1456](https://github.com/vuestorefront/magento2/pull/1456) [`e3f329ec`](https://github.com/vuestorefront/magento2/commit/e3f329ec815be7477d398277c98333c3e66e2d65) Thanks [@bartoszherba](https://github.com/bartoszherba)! - Fixed a Naming Issue in productDetails Method

  We've fixed a problem where the method name used to access product details was mistakenly written as "productDetail." It's now correctly named as "productDetails." This change ensures everything is clear and accurate in the code.
