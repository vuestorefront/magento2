## PayflowProUrlInput interface

A set of relative URLs that PayPal will use in response to various actions during the authorization process. Magento prepends the base URL to this value to create a full URL. For example, if the full URL is https://www.example.com/path/to/page.html, the relative URL is path/to/page.html. Use this input for Payflow Pro and Payment Pro payment methods.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface PayflowProUrlInput 
```
