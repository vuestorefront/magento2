# Override default queries

To override one or multiple queries without creating a custom composable for each usage, you can override the defaults ones with the `customQueries` attribute in the `middleware.config.js`file.

## Examples

Below is the example on how to override the default query for `productList`.

### Overriding query

In this example we will override `products` query by adding `cld_data` field that will retrieve Cloudinary image data from Magento.

::: warning
In order to query `cld_data`, you need to have [Cloudinary Magento extension](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/magento_integration) installed in your Magento project.

1. Inside the theme's root let's create a `customQueries` directory, and copy the content of the default `productsList` query from the `/productsList.ts` file ([Source](https://github.com/vuestorefront/magento2/blob/main/packages/api-client/src/api/products/productsList.ts)) into the newly created directory.

You can modify the query inside this file by adding `cld_data` with fields to the existing query as below:

```typescript
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

export default gql`
  query productsList($search: String = "", $filter: ProductAttributeFilterInput, $pageSize: Int = 10, $currentPage: Int = 1, $sort: ProductAttributeSortInput) {
    products(search: $search, filter: $filter, pageSize: $pageSize, currentPage: $currentPage, sort: $sort) {
      aggregations {
        attribute_code
        label
        options {
          label
          value
          count
        }
      }
      items {
        //...
        cld_data {
          image
          thumbnail
        }
        //...
      }
      page_info {
        current_page
        page_size
        total_pages
      }
      total_count
    }
  }
`;
```

::: warning
Make sure you have `graphgl-tag` installed as dependency prior using this sample code.
:::

2. In `middleware.config.js`, import the modified query

```js
import customProductsQuery from './customQueries/productList';
```

3.  Add a new property field `customQueries` under `integrations.magento` with the following code:

```js
module.exports = {
  integrations: {
    magento: {
      customQueries: {
        /* This is where we override the default query */
        products: (context) => ({
          ...context,
          query: customProductsQuery, // Your custom query
        }),
      },
      //...
    },
  },
};
```

4. Now you can restart your dev environment and view the updated data queried.

::: warning
`thumbnail` is a must-have field to query. It is used for our default image rendering via Nuxt Image. Do not remove it from the query in any circumstance.
:::

### Important notes

Only attributes presented on `ProductInterface` are accessible via GraphQL without any additional modification on the Magento side.

To be able to get any custom attributes, you must extend the GraphQL schema in Magento 2. Follow [Magento 2 documentation](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/graphql/develop/extend-existing-schema.html) to achieve that.
