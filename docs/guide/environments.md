# Demo environments

We have three demo environments where you can see and test Magento 2 integration for Vue Storefront in action. If you find a bug in any of them, please [create an issue](https://github.com/vuestorefront/magento2/issues/new/choose) in our repository to let us know about it.

## Production environment

In the production environment, you can see the latest **released and stable** version of the integration. It should be visually and feature-wise identical to the new project installed using our CLI.

## Staging environment

In the staging environment, we are testing new releases. It should be **relatively stable**, but you might still encounter some bugs.

## Development environment

In the development environment, we are testing the `develop` branch, which might contain unfinished or experimental features. It might be **unstable** both visually and feature-wise.
