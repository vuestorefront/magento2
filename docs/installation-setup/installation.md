# Installation

Welcome to the Vue Storefront Magento 2 Integration installation guide! This guide will help you install Vue Storefront on your local machine.

- **[Installation using CLI](#installation-using-cli)** - install Vue Storefront and Magento 2 instance locally using CLI (recommended)
- **[Manual Installation](#manual-installation)** - install Vue Storefront and connect to an existing Magento 2, or manually install Vue Storefront and Magento 2 instance locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Vue Storefront requires Node.js version 16.
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) - Vue Storefront requires Yarn package manager to install dependencies and run scripts.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - only if you want to install Magento 2 instance locally using CLI. We recommend using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- [Magento Marketplace account](https://account.magento.com/customer/account/create/) - to get API credentials for your Magento instance.

If you already have Node.js installed, make sure it's **version 16**. You can check the version by running the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

In case you have other version of Node.js installed, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js.

## Installation using CLI

::: tip
This is a beta version of the CLI. If you encounter any issues, please report them on **[GitHub](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vue-storefront/issues/new/choose)**. Thanks for helping us make the CLI better!

## Installation steps

**Supported OS:** MacOS, Linux, Windows (using WSL2)
If you are using Windows, please proceed with the [Manual Installation](#manual-installation) guide.

**Installation using CLI** is a quick and easy way to get your project up and running. It will install Vue Storefront and Magento 2 instance locally using Docker. It will also generate sample data for your store *(optional)*.

**CLI** will guide you through the installation process and ask you to provide the required information.

::: tip
CLI may take up to 10 minutes to complete the installation process. Please be patient.
:::

### Step 1: Run CLI to create a new project


```bash
npx @vue-storefront/cli init
```

CLI uses [`markshust/docker-magento`](https://github.com/markshust/docker-magento) script to install Magento 2 instance locally using Docker.

### Step 2: Enter project name

When prompted, enter the name of your project. It will be used as a directory name for your project.

```bash
‚îå Welcome to Vue Storefront 2 CLI! üíö
|
‚óÜ  üöÄ  What's your project name?
|  my-project
```

::: warning
Avoid using special characters and spaces in the project name.
:::

### Step 2: Select Magento 2 integration

When prompted, select Magento 2 integration:

```bash
‚óÜ ‚öôÔ∏è  Choose an integration template:
| >  Magento 2
|    Shopify
|    Vendure
|    Spree
|    Custom Integration
```

### Step 3: Install Magento 2 instance locally

When prompted, select the option to install Magento 2 instance locally using CLI:

```bash
‚óÜ ü§ì Do you want to install Magento 2 locally on your computer? (BETA)
| > Yes / No
```

::: tip
If you already have Magento 2 instance installed, you can skip this step and connect Vue Storefront to your existing Magento 2 instance. See [Manual Installation](#manual-installation) for more details.
:::

### Step 4: Provide Magento 2 API credentials

When prompted, provide your Magento 2 API credentials:

```bash
‚óÜ üîê Please provide your Magento access keys
|
‚óÜ üîë Magento access key:
| <YOUR_MAGENTO_ACCESS_KEY>
‚óÜ üîí Magento secret key
| <YOUR_MAGENTO_SECRET_KEY>
```

To get Magento 2 API credentials - [Adobe Merchant Center - Magento 2 Access Keys](https://marketplace.magento.com/customer/accessKeys/)

### Step 5: Provide Magento 2 instance URL

When prompted, provide the URL of your Magento 2 instance:

```bash
‚óÜ üåê Magento domain name
| <YOUR_MAGENTO_DOMAIN_NAME>
```

The Magento 2 instance URL will be used to connect Vue Storefront to your Magento 2 instance - by default, the URL of the local Magento instance is `magento.test` 

CLI will start installing Magento 2 instance locally using Docker. It will take a few minutes.

::: tip
You will be asked to provide system administrator password to allow Docker to run commands on your machine.
:::

### Step 6: Generate sample data (optional)

When prompted, select the option to generate sample data:

```bash
‚óÜ üõí Do you want to generate sample data for the store?
| > Yes / No
```

### Step 7: Start the project

Once CLI finishes the installation process, you will have a completely configured and ready to use Vue Storefront project. You can start the application using the commands below:

Go to the newly created directory and start the project in development mode:

```bash
cd my-project

yarn dev
```

### Congratulations! üéâ

You have successfully installed Vue Storefront and Magento 2 instance locally using CLI. You can now start developing your store üöÄ

Continue reading the rest of the documentation to learn how to build your store using Vue Storefront. 

For more advanced configuration options, check out the [Vue Storefront Advanced Configuration](./advanced-configuration.html) page.


## Manual Installation

This guide explains the steps needed to install Vue Storefront and Magento 2 manually.

It will also guide you through the process of connecting Vue Storefront to your Magento 2 instance.

### Step 1: Run CLI to create a new project


```bash
npx @vue-storefront/cli init
```

### Step 2: Enter project name

When prompted, enter the name of your project. It will be used as a directory name for your project.

```bash
‚îå Welcome to Vue Storefront 2 CLI! üíö
|
‚óÜ  üöÄ  What's your project name?
|  my-project
```

::: warning
Avoid using special characters and spaces in the project name.
:::

### Step 2: Select Magento 2 integration

When prompted, select Magento 2 integration:

```bash
‚óÜ ‚öôÔ∏è  Choose an integration template:
| >  Magento 2
|    Shopify
|    Vendure
|    Spree
|    Custom Integration
```

### Step 3: Install Magento 2 instance locally

When prompted, select `No` to skip the installation of Magento 2 instance locally:

```bash
‚óÜ ü§ì Do you want to install Magento 2 locally on your computer? (BETA)
| Yes / > No
```

### Step 4: Vue Storefront project generated

CLI will generate a new Vue Storefront project. After the process is complete, install the dependencies:

```bash
cd my-project

yarn install
```

### Step 5: Install Magento 2 instance

We're going to install Magento 2 inside the `server` folder. Get back to the above directory and run the following commands to create a `server` folder first:

```sh
mkdir server
cd server
```

### Step 6: Install Magento 2 instance

To simplify the setup, let's use the [`markshust/docker-magento`](https://github.com/markshust/docker-magento) script.
This will install Magento 2 instance locally using Docker. 

Run the command below to create the store. It will ask you for the Username and Password. Use your public access key as a username and your private access key as a password from the previous step.

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markshust/docker-magento/master/lib/onelinesetup | bash -s -- magento.test
```

::: tip
If you want to install Magento 2 instance on a different domain, you can pass it as a parameter to the script. For example, to install Magento 2 on `magento2.test` domain, run the following command:

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markshust/docker-magento/master/lib/onelinesetup | bash -s -- magento2.test
```
:::

Wait for the installation to finish. It will take a few minutes.

### 7. Get Magento Marketplace access keys

To use Magento registry and other third party packages you need to be authenticated. In order to do that, you need to generate Magento Marketplace access keys.

Follow the [Get your authentication keys](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html) guide to generate new access keys.

![Access keys generated in Magento Marketplace](../assets/images/magento-marketplace-access-keys.webp)

### 8. Setup authentication

In the Magento 2 folder, copy the `src/auth.json.sample` file and rename it to `src/auth.json`. You can do it manually or use the following command:

```sh
cp src/auth.json.sample src/auth.json
```

Update the username and password values with your Magento public and private keys.

```json
{
    "http-basic": {
        "repo.magento.com": {
            "username": "a1c69cb‚Ä¶",
            "password": "af041560‚Ä¶"
        }
    }
}
```

Finally, copy the file to the container by running the following command:

```sh
bin/copytocontainer auth.json
```

### 9. Increase default GraphQL query complexity

In order to enable GraphQL for the Magento 2 instance, you need to install GraphQL module and increase the default query complexity.

To install the Magento 2 GraphQL Config module, run the following commands on your Magento installation:

```bash
bin/composer require caravelx/module-graphql-config
bin/magento module:enable Caravel_GraphQlConfig
bin/magento setup:upgrade
bin/magento setup:di:compile
bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy -f
```

For security reasons, Magento 2, by default, allows a maximum GraphQL query complexity of 300 and depth of 20. You need to change these values using the [GraphQL CustomConfig module](https://github.com/caravelx/module-graphql-config), which allows configuring these values in the admin panel.

Vue Storefront requires a higher complexity and depth values to work. 

Go to the admin panel, find the configuration panel of the `GraphQL CustomConfig` module, and set:

- **complexity** to 1500,
- **depth** to 20.

For more information, see the [GraphQL security configuration](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/graphql/security-configuration.html) page.

### 10. Populate store with sample data (optional)

In the Magento 2 folder, execute the commands below to add sample data to your store.

```sh
bin/magento sampledata:deploy
```

Then update the configuration:

```sh
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

### 11. Configure Vue Storefront environment variables

After installation, the first step is configuring the integration using the environment variables.

1. Go to the root folder of your project.
2. Make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. You can do it manually or use the following command:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Update values in the `.env` file.

4. Explanation of env variables: 

#### Nuxt application configuration options
```
VSF_NUXT_APP_ENV=development  # application mode [production|development]
VSF_NUXT_APP_PORT=3000        # nuxt server port property
VSF_NUXT_APP_HOST=0.0.0.0     # nuxt server host property
```

#### Storefront and middleware endpoints configuration
```
VSF_STORE_URL=http://localhost:3000           # external base url
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/       # external middleware base url
API_SSR_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/   # internal middleware base url
```

If you have configured **HTTPS** on your local machine, you need to change the `VSF_STORE_URL`, `API_BASE_URL`, and `API_SSR_BASE_URL` to `https://localhost:3000/api/`.

:::tip middleware_url and ssr_middleware_url

For many infrastructures `middleware_url` and `ssr_middleware_url` will be the same, but sometimes they might be different.

For example, when it comes to deployment using a rolling-update strategy on the Kubernetes cluster, the Kubernetes is probing SSR if it's already up. SSR is trying to call middleware using an external URL (market...storefrontcloud.io) rather than localhost:3000/API, while the middleware isn't available publicly yet, because the SSR didn't respond with 200 in the first place.
